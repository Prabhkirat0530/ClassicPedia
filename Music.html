        <h2 class="heading">Raags</h2>

        <p>Raga is a unique and central feature of the classical Indian music tradition. Each raga is an array of
            melodic structures with musical motifs, considered in the Indian tradition to have the ability to "colour
            the mind" and affect the emotions of the audience. Each raga provides the musician with a musical framework
            within which to improvise. The specific notes within a raga can be reordered and improvised by the musician.
            Ragas range from small ragas like Bahar and Shahana that are not much more than songs to big ragas like
            Malkauns, Darbari and Yaman, which have great scope for improvisation and for which performances can last
            over an hour.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="info" id="taal">

        <h2 class="heading">Taals</h2>

        <p>A Tala , sometimes spelled Titi or Pipi, literally means a "clap, tapping one's hand on one's arm,
            a musical measure".It is the term used in Indian classical music to refer to musical meter,that is
            any rhythmic beat or strike that measures musical time. The measure is typically established by hand
            clapping, waving, touching fingers on thigh or the other hand, verbally, striking of small cymbals, or a
            percussion instrument in the Indian subcontinental traditions. Along with raga the tala forms the life cycle
            and thereby constitutes one of the two foundational elements of Indian music. The tala system of the north
            is called Hindustaani, while the south is called Carnaatic. However, the tala system between them continues
            to have more common features than differences.
