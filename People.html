            producer and film actor. He is the eldest son of tabla player Ustad Allah Rakha. One of the unique
            contributions of Zakir is his use of the "bayan" to create melody. He uses this throughout his playing but
            especially so during the "sawaal-jawaab" section of a recital, where the instrumentalist playing the sitar,
            sarod, santoor, etc. and the tabla player typically have a "question-answer" back and forth. The line "Zakir
            Hussain Tabela Ivaltana" in the Tamil song "Telephone Manipol" in Indian (1996) film directed by S.Shankar
            is a tribute to him. This song was written by poet Vairamuthu. he was awarded the United States National
            Endowment for the Arts' National Heritage Fellowship, the highest award given to traditional artists and
            musicians.
