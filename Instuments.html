            <h2>Sitar</h2>

            <p>The sitar is a plucked stringed instrument used in Hindustani classical music.The instrument was invented
                in medieval India and flourished in the 16th and 17th
                centuries and arrived at its present form in 18th-century India.
            </p>
            <p>Used widely throughout the Indian subcontinent, the sitar became popularly known in the wider world
                through the works of Ravi Shankar, beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
                A sitar can have 18, 19, 20, or 21 strings. Six or seven of these are played strings which run over
                curved, raised frets, and the remainder are sympathetic strings which run underneath the frets and
                resonate in sympathy with the played strings.
